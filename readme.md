## About 

I write this project since I love audio books but sometimes the selection of books is limited sometimes. 

## Next up

    - Clean up and documentation

## Installtion
    - Install `espeak-ng` or `espeak`. Note that if you are on Mac M1. I suggest using Macport because homebrew will install espeak in a different architecture.
    - install requirements `pip install -r ./requirement.txt`

## Running


    - `export PHONEMIZER_ESPEAK_LIBRARY=/opt/local/lib/libespeak-ng.dylib`
